# R_Hypothesis_Testing

This is an example of a hypothesis test I conducted in R as part of coursework during my time in the Universsity of Kansas's masters program in Statistics and Data Analytics.

### Description

The hypothesis test covers two different questions:
* Is there a difference in birth rates from two different years.
* Is there a differece in birth rates between two different geographical areas within the same year

The program was created in R Studio using R Markdown and does knit into a HTML file. 

### Dependencies
